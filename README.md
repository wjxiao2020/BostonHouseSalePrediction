# Boston House Sale Analysis & Prediction Using Regression Models


This project used house sale price data scraped from [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com) as of November 2023 to interpret the Boston housing market, 
focusing on how property details and timing affect sales outcomes. 
Our findings reveal geographical and temporal price variations, offering strategic insights for market participants. 
We employed and compared multiple regression and polynomial multiple regression analyses, and chose the simpler multiple regression as our final model for its potential better generalizability. 
Although our model captures notable trends reaching a validation R<sup>2</sup> of 0.65, its predictive precision is limited, indicating the potential influence of external factors.
This research serves as a foundational step for stakeholders aiming to optimize their engagement with the Boston real estate market.

For more details, please refer to the [final report](https://github.com/wjxiao2020/BostonHouseSalePrediction/blob/main/Report.pdf) for a deeper, elaborated insight 
and the Jupyter notebook containing the end-to-end pipeline we created that covers all of the web-scrape, preprocess, analysis, and visualization for the data, with model construction, training, and validation.
